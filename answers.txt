Question 1:

FIFO OS simulation with 1 CPU
# of Context Switches: 99
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 389.9 s

FIFO OS simulation with 2 CPU
# of Context Switches: 110
Total execution time: 35.9 s
Total time spent in READY state: 80.9 s


FIFO OS simulation with 4 CPU
# of Context Switches: 182
Total execution time: 33.4 s
Total time spent in READY state: 0.4 s

There is not a linear relationship.
